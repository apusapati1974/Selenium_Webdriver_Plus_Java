Java 8 Features
***************
	
	>> In Java 8 we have two features
	   1.Static Method
	   2.Default Method.
	
	Lambda Expressions
	******************
		>> A lambda expression is an anonymous function. A function that doesnot have a name and doesn't belong to any class.
		>> To create an lambda expression, we can specify input parameters on the left side of lambda operator ->, and place
		the expression or block of statements on the right side of the lambda operator.
		>> To use lambda expression, you need to either create your own functional interface or use the predefined functional
		interface provided by java.
	 
		Note : An interface with only single abstract method is called functional Interface.
