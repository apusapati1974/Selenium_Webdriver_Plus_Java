	2.Final Keyword
	***************	
		>> Final Keyword can be used in 3 cases
		   # can be used with variable, it becomes constants.
		   # can be used with the classes, it cannot be inherited.
		   # can be used with the method,it cannot be override.
    	>> if we want to create variable as constant we can use final.
    	>> With the help of final keyword we can make constants.
    	>> When ever we are making constants, it is mandatory to give the initial value.
    	>> If it is constant it is not allowing to change the value.
    	>> In Third approch we have an concept of Overriding
    	   # So if the parent and child class have same name & same signature method that is called Overriding.
    3.Super Keyword

    4.Static Keyword
    ****************
    	>> These are the 4 items in Static Keyword.
    	   # Call class members without creating object.
    	   # Share data between multiple objects.
    	   # Static members can access only other static members.
    	   # Static block.
    	>> The method which is non-static is called as Instance Method.
