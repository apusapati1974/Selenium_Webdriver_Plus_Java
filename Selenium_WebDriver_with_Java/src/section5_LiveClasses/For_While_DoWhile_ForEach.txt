*********************************************************
	When we use looping ...
	***********************
		Whenever we want to perform any task / group of task multiple time we can do it by using loop.
		we can control the loop how many times u want to run it.
		
	Types of loops ...
	*******************
		1. For Loop  2. While Loop  3. Do While Loop  4.For Each loop (Advance For Loop)
		
	Rules for the loop ...
	**********************
	    Rule 1 - Whenever u r confirm how many times we need to run loop
	    Rule 2 - Whenever the value increase/decrease constantly
	    
	Note - For & While loop are alternative to each other
	
	Rules of While loop ...
	************************
		Rule 1 - Starting value is defined before the loop
		Rule 2 - Condition check is done inside the loop
		Rule 3 - task should be written inside the body of the while loop
		Rule 4 - increment / decrement should be written inside the body of while loop.
		Rule 5 - Not confirm then use while loop
		Rule 6 - Increment / Decrement is not constant then use while loop.	
		
	Notes of Do-While Loop
	**********************
		First it will execute the loop then we check the condition.
		For & While loop are Entry control loop & Do-While loop are Exit control loop.
	
	Notes for ForEach loop
	**********************
		For Each loop is also known as Advance For loop.
		This loop is applicable when we store the multiple data with same name.
		For each loop is used for group of data.
